Utilized Roboflow to create and document a computer vision algorothm. Will incorporate more code and funcionality for swimmmers in the near future. Futher testing and fine tuning for a more precise model is needed. Will experiment with more data sets and get different angles of swimming shots for more accurate readings. With how things are looking, this is better than I expected! High precision and mAP was indeed higher than prediction which was around 70-75.
